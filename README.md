# Chimera Spoofer

Chimera Spoofer is a powerful utility for Linux designed to enhance privacy and anonymity by modifying system-level identifiers. It can spoof and restore various fingerprints, including hostname, machine ID, OS release, SSH keys, network settings, and file timestamps.

## üõ†Ô∏è Building from Source

### Prerequisites

* Python ‚â• 3.8 (needed only for the build tool)
* `clang++` or `g++` with C++17 support

Mint, the minimal build system, is now our single source-of-truth for compiling Chimera Spoofer. Install it once via `pip`:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade mint-build   # requires Mint ‚â• 0.2.0
```

### Build

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/LimmeDev/ChimeraSpoofer.git
cd ChimeraSpoofer

# Release build (-O3) ‚Äì binary will be placed in ./build/‚Ä¶/chimera
mint build -r
```

The legacy `compile.sh` now acts as a thin wrapper around the same command, so

```bash
./compile.sh   # does exactly the same as `mint build -r`
```

This will generate the `chimera` executable and the `interceptor.so` shared library.

## üöÄ Usage

There are two primary ways to use Chimera Spoofer:

1.  **Direct Execution**: Run the main executable with root privileges.
    ```bash
    sudo ./chimera
    ```

2.  **Interceptor**: Use the `chimera.sh` script to launch an application with the spoofer's interceptor preloaded.
    ```bash
    ./chimera.sh <your_command_here>
    ```
    For example, to launch `google-chrome` with the interceptor:
    ```bash
    ./chimera-browser.sh
    ```
